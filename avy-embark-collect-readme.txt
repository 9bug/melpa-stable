This packages provides two commands, `avy-embark-collect-choose' and
`avy-embark-collect-act', that use avy to jump to an Embark Collect
entry and choose it or act on it, respectively.

I no longer recommend using this package, and suggest users migrate
to the excellent link-hint package by Fox Kiester.
