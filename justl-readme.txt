Emacs extension for driving just files

To list all the recipes present in your justfile, call

M-x justl

You don't have to call it from the actual justfile.  Calling it from
the directory where the justfile is present should be enough.

Alternatively, if you want to just execute a recipe, call

M-x justl-execute-recipe-in-dir
