This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow.
This package assumes familiarity with GTD.

Upgrading? make sure you read the CHANGELOG.

This package provides a system that allows you to capture incoming things
into an inbox, then process the inbox and categorize each item based on the
GTD categories.  It leverages org-agenda to show today's items as well as the
NEXT items.  It also has a simple project management system, which currently
assumes all tasks in a project are sequential.

For a comprehensive instruction manual, see the file `README.org'.
